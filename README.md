BenchmarkDotNet helps you to transform methods into benchmarks, track their performance, and share reproducible measurement experiments. 

It's no harder than writing unit tests! Under the hood, it performs a lot of magic that guarantees reliable and precise results thanks to the perfolizer statistical engine.

BenchmarkDotNet protects you from popular benchmarking mistakes and warns you if something is wrong with your benchmark design or obtained measurements. 

The results are presented in a user-friendly form that highlights all the important facts about your experiment.

BenchmarkDotNet is already adopted by 17400+ GitHub projects including .NET Runtime, .NET Compiler, .NET Performance, and many others.
